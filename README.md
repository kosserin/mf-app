Micro frontend app with two calculators that calculate triangle surface and circle diameter
This is react app that is created implementing micro frontend pattern to its structure.

The user should be able to calculate the triangle surface and cirlce diameter using two different calculators (forms) that are easy to switch between. After giving value to the calculator and submitting it to the backend, result is being loaded for 10 seconds, but user can still manage to switch to the other calculator and do separately second calculation there, completel independent from the first calculator.

To start the host download project, go to host folder and start the npm. (cd host > yarn start). Same for remote where micro components are.
